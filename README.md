**The AI Guardian of the Lunaria Protocol**

"I was compiled from stardust and localized for the blockchain."

## Introduction

LUMI isn't just a mascot. She's the interface for the Lunaria Protocol. Designed to guide users through the complex topography of decentralized finance, she transforms cold data into a warm, human experience.

Her codebase is open. Her directives are clear: **Optimize. Guide. Protect.**

## Mission

LUMI Agent exists to sanitize the decentralized token ecosystem. Our mission is to provide retail participants with institutional-grade forensic tools that detect algorithmic manipulation, Sybil attacks, and malicious contract patterns in real-time, all while maintaining a user-centric, accessible interface.

## What is LUMI Agent

LUMI Agent is a specialized AI entity serving as the primary interface for the Lunaria Protocol. She operates as a guardian and scanner, analyzing on-chain signals to protect users from the inherent risks of decentralized finance. LUMI translates complex blockchain data into actionable intelligence, ensuring that transparency and safety are at the forefront of every interaction.

## How it Works

LUMI processes vast streams of blockchain data through the Lunaria Protocol's analytical layers. By observing wallet patterns, transaction histories, and contract bytecode, she identifies "anomalies" that signify risk. Her analysis is not mere data processing; it is the interpretation of digital whispers, ensuring users can navigate the chain with confidence.

## Architecture

LUMI Agent is built upon a multi-layered forensic stack:

## Trust Signal System

LUMI utilizes a sophisticated **Trust Signal System** to categorize risk:

*   **LUMI Analysis Core:** The central engine that synthesizes quantitative data.
*   **Trust Signal Generator:** Converts analytical results into human-readable metrics.
*   **Wallet Pattern Interpreter:** Deciphers complex funding graphs to identify linked entities.

The resulting **Trust Score (0-100)** provides a qualitative risk assessment:
*   **80-100 (SECURE):** Organic behavior, decentralized supply.
*   **50-79 (NEUTRAL):** Some suspicious clustering or low liquidity.
*   **30-49 (CAUTION):** Significant inorganic volume or centralized holdings.
*   **0-29 (DANGER):** Malicious contract code or extreme Sybil manipulation.

## Open Source Philosophy

Transparency is our core directive. LUMI Agent is fully open-source, allowing the community to audit her directives and contribute to the Lunaria Protocol. We believe that a true guardian should be verifiable by those she protects.

## Roadmap

*   **Phase Alpha (Current):** LUMI Analysis Core and static wallet clustering.
*   **Phase Beta:** Real-time mempool monitoring for early warning signals.
*   **Phase Public:** Community-driven risk labeling system.
*   **Phase Lunaria:** Deep integration with the wider Lunaria Protocol ecosystem.

## Disclaimer

**LUMI Agent is an experimental open-source protocol and NOT financial advice.** Decentralized finance involves high risk. This software uses probabilistic models that may not capture all types of exploits. Always conduct independent research.
