# Contributing to PumpGuardX

We welcome contributions from security researchers, data scientists, and developers who share our mission of sanitizing the DeFi ecosystem.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Research & Analysis
If you identify a new manipulation pattern on Pump.fun, please document it in the `docs/methodology.md` or submit a research paper to the `docs/` folder.

### 2. Model Improvements
We are constantly looking to refine our ensemble classifier. If you have experience with:
- GNNs (Graph Neural Networks)
- Time-series anomaly detection
- Smart contract static analysis

Please reach out to the Research Group.

### 3. Frontend & UI
Help us make forensic data more accessible to retail users. Our tech stack is React/Next.js.

## Code Standards
- **Clean Code:** Use meaningful variable names and document complex algorithms.
- **Testing:** All analysis modules must have associated unit tests in the `tests/` directory.
- **Tone:** Professional, research-oriented, and objective.

## Security
If you find a vulnerability in our analysis pipeline, please report it via a GitHub Issue titled **[SEC]**.
